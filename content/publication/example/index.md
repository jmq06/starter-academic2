abstract: Mathematical thinking is in high demand in the global market, but
  approximately six percent of school-age children across the globe experience
  math difficulties (Shalev, et al., 2000). The home math environment (HME),
  which includes all math-related activities, attitudes, beliefs, expectations,
  and utterances in the home, may be associated with children’s math
  development. In order to examine the relation between the HME and children’s
  math abilities, a preregistered meta-analysis was conducted to estimate the
  average weighted correlation coefficient (r) between the HME and children’s
  math achievement and how potential moderators (i.e., assessment, study, and
  sample features) might contribute to study heterogeneity. A multilevel
  correlated effects model using 631 effect sizes from 64 quantitative studies
  comprised of 68 independent samples found a positive, statistically
  significant average weighted correlation of r = .13 (SE = .02, p < .001). Our
  combined sensitivity analyses showed that the present findings were robust,
  and that the sample of studies has evidential value. A number of assessment,
  study, and sample characteristics contributed to study heterogeneity, showing
  that no single feature of HME research was driving the large between-study
  differences found for the association between the HME and children’s math
  achievement. These findings indicate that children’s environments and
  interactions related to their learning are supported in the specific context
  of math learning. Our results also show that the HME represents a setting in
  which children learn about math through social interactions with their
  caregivers (Vygotsky, 1978), and what they learn depends on the influence of
  many levels of environmental input (Bronfenbrenner, 1979) and the specificity
  of input children receive (Bornstein, 2002).

summary: The findings of this meta-analysis suggest that children’s home math
  environments (e.g., parent-child math interactions) are positively associated
  with children’s math achievement. To promote children’s math skills, it may be
  beneficial to support parents in providing positive home math experiences for
  their children.
