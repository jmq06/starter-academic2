Currently, I am Senior Data Analyst at [Hubble Contacts](https://www.hubblecontacts.com/). Hubble specializes in subscription-based contact lens delivery, providing fast, easy service with direct delivery of your contacts right to your home. 

In my role, I liase with multiple departments including Finance, Marketing and Merchandising, and Operations to ensure smoothly-running analytics pipelines. 
--I am a member of the finance team, where I have worked with our Controller to overhaul our financial planning model to ensure more accurate forecasting of our P&L reports. I also maintain weekly reporting of key performance indicators of our business. 
--I work closely with our Cheif Marketing Officer and Director of Digital Media to calculate our marketing analyticsm including customer acqusitions, associated costs, and subscriber base growth and churn rates. 
--Further, I also interface with operations, including with our Senior Vice President of Operations to build our warehousing metrics and product-specific analytics.

Presently I specialize in Google BigQuery for database querying and management and aggregate analytics, Google Analytics and Supermetrics for marketing metrics, Tableau for dashboarding and visualizations, and Python for more nuanced data science and analytics and data management. 

Formerly, I was a research scientist in the Florida Center for Reading Research at Florida State University, where I served as data scientist for the [Reach Every Reader project ](https://reacheveryreader.gse.harvard.edu/)funded by the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative and a methodologist for the [Quantitative Methodology and Innovation Division](qmi.fsu.edu) at FCRR. Before joining FCRR in 2017, I was a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at The University of Texas at Austin in the Meadows Center for Preventing Educational Risk. 

Outside of work I enjoy spending time with my husband catching up on Star Wars and Star Trek episdoes, running and training for races, watching sports of all kinds, reading sci-fi and fantasy novels, and cuddling with my two cats.
