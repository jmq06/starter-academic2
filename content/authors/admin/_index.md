Forerly, I was a research scientist in the Florida Center for Reading Research at Florida State University, where I served as data scientist for the [Reach Every Reader project ](https://reacheveryreader.gse.harvard.edu/)funded by the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative and a methodologist for the [Quantitative Methodology and Innovation Division](qmi.fsu.edu) at FCRR.  Before joining FCRR in 2017, I was a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at The University of Texas at Austin under the mentoring of Greg Roberts and Sharon Vaughn in the Meadows Center for Preventing Educational Risk. 
<!-- 
I am a current student in the Interdisciplinary Data Science Masters Program as a Computer Science Major at FSU. -->

Outside of work I enjoy spending time with my husband, watching sports of all kinds, reading sci-fi and fantasy novels, weightlifting and running, and cuddling with my two cats.
