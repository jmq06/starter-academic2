## Hello!

My name is Jamie Quinn. I'm a researcher and methodologist at the Florida Center for Reading Research at Florida State University. Prior to working at FSU, I was a postdoctoral fellow at The University of Texas at Austin working in the data analysis team in the Meadows Center for Preventing Educational Risk (MCPER). During my time at MCPER I worked under the guidance of Greg Roberts and Sharon Vaughn. 

I'll be using this space to discuss new data wrangling ideas, thoughts about data analysis, and data visualizations I've created. My hope is to share what I've learned so that others can learn how to accomplish the same things with their data.
