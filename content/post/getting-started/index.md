## Hello!

My name is Jamie Quinn. I'm a researcher and methodologist at the Florida Center for Reading Research at Florida State University. Prior to working at FSU, I was a postdoctoral fellow at The University of Texas at Austin working in the data analysis team in the Meadows Center for Preventing Educational Risk (MCPER). My time at MCPER 

I'll be using this space to discuss new data wrangling ideas, thoughts about data analysis, and data visualizations I've created and how others can attempt the same things with their data.
